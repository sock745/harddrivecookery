Attached are images of the process I took to replace a hard drive from an old iMac.

The main processes included the following:
  *cutting adhesives from the side of the screen
  *taking off screen
  *removing speaker to expose harddrive mounting holes
  *remove harddrive
  *attach new drive + ssd adapter
  *reattach speaker
  *replace old adhesives with new ones
  *remount screen
